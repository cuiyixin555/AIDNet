Please put the unzipped folders (RainTrainH, RainTrainL, RainHeavy, RainLight) into ./datasets/train/, and put the unzipped folders (Rain100H, Rain100L, SPA and test12) into ./datasets/test/

1. RainTrainH and Rain100H
RainTrainH and Rain100H are from http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/Projects/joint_rain_removal.html.
RainTrainH has 1800 rainy images for training, and Rain100H has 100 rainy images for testing. 

2. RainTrainL and Rain100L 
RainTrainL and Rain100L are from http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/Projects/joint_rain_removal.html.
RainTrainL has 200 rainy images for training, and Rain100L has 100 rainy images for testing.

These datasets at http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/Projects/joint_rain_removal.html seem to be modified. But we still use the original one, since the models and results in recent papers are all based on the original dataset.

3. Rain12
This dataset only includes 12 rainy images from http://yu-li.github.io/paper/li_cvpr16_rain.zip

4. SPA-data
This dataset includes 1000 real rainy images from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eSGgE_I4juiTsz0d81l3Kq3v943UUjiG

Updating:
The authors of Rain100H and Rain100L have updated the datasets of Rain100H and Rain100L, both of which include 1,800 training
pairs and 200 testing images. We notate them as RainHeavy ? and RainLight ? , respectively.
